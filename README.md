# DotNetCoreGraphQLDemo
This Repo contains demo example for GraphQL with dotnet core

### POC Completed for GraphQL With different resolver or datasource

1. Used Entityframework core as datasource with and without argument
2. Used Dapper ORM as datasource with argument
3. Used CQRS Design Pattern using Mediatr and EntityFramework core
4. Used REST API or using HttpClient Remote Request get result and used in GraphQL

## There is another demo console app for Generating GraphQL Type Class based on DotNet Domain Mode.

As There is too much repettive and boiler plate code for defining type and field based on existing Domain model
and Entity Model. I have created POC demo which generate graphQL Class type for dotnet and saved to bin/debug folder[App Directory]
